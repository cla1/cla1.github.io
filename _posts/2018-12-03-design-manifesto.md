# Introduction

It perplexes me how we live in a society where computer programmers are creating the systems that are changing our world as we know it, but they aren't ever required to learn the basics of Human-Computer Interaction. This is not to say that HCI is necessary to successfully code functional software or that every computer programmer needs a complete mastery of the field. However, at least for me, even learning the basics of HCI has allowed me to view the software I write through a whole new perspective. Before this course, I didn't think HCI was necessary for programmers, especially since there's nothing that required me to take it. However, after taking the course, I've realized that we've learned invaluable techniques that not only give us tools to surpass design issues, but also provide us a deeper understanding of our users that we should always consider. What scares me the most about all of this is that I knew so little about this field that I didn't know I was missing anything.

This leads me to the work that I, and my groupmates, have accomplished over the last 3 months. During this semester we designed a mobile application that allows curators to both connect with and learn about the museum visitors that view their work. Even though it took us awhile to reach a seemingly simple design, we believe that our application could really make data useful so curators can better understand their audience. However, creating a good application would not have been possible without the methods we learned from UX design, so I want to share 7 of the most important learning experiences through our journey.


# Teamwork Makes the Dream Work

At the start of this project, me, Kenneth, and Landon were randomly put together to form a group. However, by the end of this semester, we managed to become a team. What's the distinction? A group is just a collection of people, but a team is a cohesive unit that cooperates to achieve a goal. As Katzenbach and Smith assert, "no group ever becomes a team until it can hold itself accountable as a team," and the importance of this was probably one of the most stunning realizations (Katzenbach and Smith, The Discipline of Teams). From this process, I learned two very important aspects of working in a team:


### 1. Be Unnecessarily Explicit 

When this project began, I figured work would be divided and we would just do our parts independently, eventually combining everything into a single deliverable. Even though our team contract emphasized communication, this was mostly in regard to any problems that had to be resolved. In terms of deliverables, we vaguely came up with "equal division of work, but also flexibility" as our focus. However, it soon became apparent to me that "equal division of work" was not so automatic. 


One of our first assignments involved a contextual inquiry and a reflection (contextual inquiry check-in). However, none of us took the initiative to set up a meeting with any of our proposed users. After mentioning this to the group the day before the assignment was due, we frantically looked around to see if anyone was free, and we were lucky enough to conduct a last minute interview with a WCMA curator. This allowed us to complete our deliverable, but we realized that we never wanted this situation to happen again. To resolve this problem, from that point on, we clearly labeled who was designated to do what part of each assignment. Even though we learned this through experience, this key takeaway was actually summed up from one of Pausch's tips for working successfully in a group: "**put [responsibilities] in writing**" (Pausch, Tips for Working Successfully in a Group). Even though this may seem like an unnecessary step in working with groups, we learned the hard way that explicitly writing out responsibilities can prevent situations like this from occurring. 


### 2. Recognize Individual Talent

This is one aspect of teams that may seem too small or intuitive to deserve its own title. However, we did not actually delegate assignments that reflected our personal skills until way too late in our design process. Ironically, our team contract not only specified that we would delegate "based on skills or skills we want to develop," but it actually listed some of our personal talents. However, for some reason, we never actually divided up labor based on these talents. Honestly, I took the initiative to do a large part of the planning (this was actually one of my listed skills), so this may have been largely my own oversight in not recognizing my own groupmates' talents. However, I did eventually realize that Landon is extremely creative and fantastic at generating new ideas, and Kenneth is incredible at basically anything artistic-based, from storyboards to video prototypes. If I were to do a project like this again, recognizing individual talent is one aspect of a team that I would make sure to prioritize.
